# Ubuntu 26.04 Template Fix: no networking in the initrd
# Purpose: Stop dracut from bringing up the NIC via DHCP before cloud-init
#          gets a chance to rename+configure it.
#
# Ported from homelab-proxmox-elastic's packer/ubuntu-26.04 (ADR-6 in that
# repo's README.md), which hit and fixed this live on the same OS/platform.
#
# Unlike that repo, this script does NOT run as a Packer shell provisioner.
# It is base64-embedded into locals.pkr.hcl and executed via curtin
# in-target from http/user-data.yml.tpl's late-commands, i.e. chrooted into
# /target *before* the installer reboots into the freshly installed system.
# The race this fixes happens on that very first boot, before Packer's SSH
# communicator or any provisioner ever runs — a post-boot provisioner would
# always be one boot too late to prevent it.
#
# Usage: chrooted as root (curtin in-target), or directly as root.
